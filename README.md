// First java solo project, making a fitness tracking app with multiple features described below: 
// User Input: The program prompts the user to enter their name and exercise details, such as exercise type, 
exercise name, sets/reps, and exercise time.
// Exercise Types: The program supports two exercise types: weight training and cardio. Users can choose between 
these two types for their exercises.
// Exercise Tracking: The program allows users to track their exercises by adding them to a FitnessTracker object. 
Each exercise is stored with its type, name, reps/sets, and time.
// Custom Exercises: Users can add custom exercises by providing a name and the appropriate details 
(sets/reps for weight training, time for cardio).
// Exercise Summary: At the end of the program, the user is presented with an exercise summary. 
The exercises are sorted alphabetically by name, and the summary includes details like exercise type, name, reps/sets or time.
// Interactive User Interface: The program provides a menu-driven interface where users can select exercise types, 
specific exercises, and navigate through the program easily.
// Validation: The program validates user input to ensure it is within the expected range or format. For example, 
it checks that the number of sets/reps and exercise time are positive integers.
// Quit Confirmation: The program asks for confirmation before quitting to ensure that the user intends to exit the program.
// Motivational Messages: The program includes motivational messages throughout the code, encouraging the user to stay committed and dedicated to their fitness goals.
// Date Display: The program displays the current date at the end of the exercise summary, adding a personal touch to the output.
